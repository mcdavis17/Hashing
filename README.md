# This project creates a hash table and inserts words from a file into the table. The program keeps track of the total number of words, the number of unique words, the line numbers that each word appears on, and the total number of collisons for inserting all the words into the table. The user can then search for a word and see the line numbers where the word appears and the number of collisons that occured during the search.
